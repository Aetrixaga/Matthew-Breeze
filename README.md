Hello, I’m Matthew Breeze aka @Aetrixaga

Studies and Experience:

I am currently studying Msci Mathematical Physics at the University of Nottingham. Most of my code relating to my degree will be modelling physical systems using python,
but my interests are more broad than that, from big data to mobile app development I have worked on a variety of project types throughout my internships.
Unfortunatly some of this code I could not sample and take with me to present here but what I could, I have.
  
Direction and the Future:

With such a varied set of projects it may be tricky to determine where my interests lie, my fundamental requirement to bring enthusiasm, energy and fresh perspective to a
project is how it brings new value to society by solving or reducing a problem faced by society as a whole. Whether it be medical, environmental or investing in new
enterprises I hope to bring more value to projects that are themselves valuable to us all.
